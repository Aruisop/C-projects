Rock Paper Scissor is one of the most common games played by everyone once in their childhood, where two persons use their hands and choose random objects between rock, paper, or scissor,
and their choice decides the winner between them. 
What if a single person can play this game? With a computer, just by using a single C program, we can design the game for Rock Paper and Scissors.
By just using basic C knowledge like if-else statements, random value generation, and input-output of control, we can create a scalable and robust program that helps us kill boredom.
The created application has a feature where we can play the game, and maintain the score of Person 1 and Person 2.
